# This module is now in paragon_base as paragon_list_options

# E3 List options

A module containing plugins for creating select lists. It depends on [List Predifined Options](https://www.drupal.org/project/list_predefined_options)

## Why use this
This module allows us to keep the configuration for a list in code instead of config. It makes updating and changing options easier.

## Patches
The plugins use Attributes instead of Annotations. Currently, the module does not support Attributes, but there is a [MR](https://www.drupal.org/project/list_predefined_options/issues/3512586).
